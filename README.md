## / DESIGN DIRECTION

The visual identity moves away from corporate sterility to a bold, motivation-driven interface.

* **Aesthetic:** Dark Mode Industrial / Brutalist influence.
* **Palette:** Monochrome (Black/White) with high-voltage "Neon Yellow" accents.
* **Typography:**
    * **Headings:** *Oswald* — Condensed and bold for impact.
    * **Body:** *Inter* — Clean and readable for UI elements.
* **User Experience:** Priority on visual storytelling and frictionless navigation ("Join the Club" flow).
